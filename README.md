# MapArt-Maker
An Image to litematic converter for making Minecraft Maparts.

 ## Folder Layout
All code is in `src`.

`Processing` is Hunsinger's color code

`GUI` is polarbub's GUI

`libraries` all the libraries used. PSL is `polar standard library`.

## Build System
I'm using cmake because it's somewhat cross-platform.

In Visual Studio you can open CMakeLists.txt as a project.

In CLion you can open the folder containing CMakeLists.txt.

## TODO Comments
CLion has a todo feature that lets me find comments starting with a configurable value. I have it set up like so;

1) `ADD:` A feature needs to be added.
2) `TEST:` A new feature needs to be tested.
3) `FIX:` A bug needs to be fixed.
4) `DEBUG:` A mystery bug needs to have the cause found on.
