# MapArt-Maker
An Image to litematic converter for making Minecraft Maparts.

 ## Folder Layout
All code is in `src`.

`Processing` is Hunsinger's color code

`GUI` is polarbub's GUI

## Build System
I'm using cmake because it's somewhat cross platform.

In Visual Studio you can open CMakeLists.txt as a project.

In CLion you can open the folder containing CMakeLists.txt.
